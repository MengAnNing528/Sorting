# Sorting
Key Features:
Sorting Algorithms:
Selection Sort - Finds minimum element and places it at beginning

Bubble Sort - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if in wrong order

Insertion Sort - Builds final sorted array one item at a time

Merge Sort - Divide and conquer algorithm

Shell Sort - Generalized insertion sort with gaps

Quick Sort - Efficient divide and conquer with partitioning

Heap Sort - Uses binary heap data structure

Search Algorithms:
Sequential Search - Linear search through each element

Binary Search - Requires sorted array, divides search space in half

Interpolation Search - Improved binary search for uniformly distributed data

Fibonacci Search - Uses Fibonacci numbers to divide search space

Time Complexities:
Sorting:
Selection, Bubble, Insertion: O(n²)

Shell Sort: O(n log n) to O(n²)

Merge, Heap: O(n log n)

Quick: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case

Searching:
Sequential: O(n)

Binary, Interpolation, Fibonacci: O(log n)

This implementation provides a complete toolkit of fundamental sorting and searching algorithms in C++!
